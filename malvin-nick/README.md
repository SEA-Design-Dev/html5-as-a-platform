## Photo Capture Page
Followed the [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/](Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5) to get video capture working in the browser. Extended the functionality by adding an event listener to play a shutter snap sound, as well as the ability to download the captured photo.
