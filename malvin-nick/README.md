# Malvin & Nick - HTML5 as a Platform

## Form & Video Page


## Photo Capture Page
Followed the [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/) to get video capture working in the browser. Extended the functionality by adding an event listener to play a shutter snap sound, as well as the ability to download the captured photo.
