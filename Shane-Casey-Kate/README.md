+### A project for Code Fellows B25 by Kate Fleming, Casey Holly, and Shane Kalles.
+
+Our build of HTML5-as-a-platform.
+
+Capturing photos with the camera access was pretty simple, but being able to capture video is really difficult, since  the new file would need to be stored somewhere and local storage doesn't work for this type of information.
+
+Our form layout is simple and we made sure to include local storage. Found that you need to write different JavaScript code for local storage of text items vs. radio checkboxes. Another obstical we came across is that if a button is inside a form is takes on "submit" function which if used to trigger an event you need to change its default to not reload the page.
+
+Adding the video element is very simple and the controls available to you in HTML5 make for an easy addition to any page with the playback results that you want. We didn't add any custom controls but this process seems fairly easy.
