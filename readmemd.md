# HTML 5 as a Platform
#### By Marissa and Monica


## Overview

This web application has three different sections:

1. Camera access: access your camera through this application and place yourself on the beach
2. Video: Check out a video of the beach accompanied with the sounds of waves
3. Contact form with audio: Contact the "resort" (creators of the website) with a form. Local storage is also used to make sure the user does not lose any information.
