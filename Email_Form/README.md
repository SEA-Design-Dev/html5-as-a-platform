#Email Form Example
A sample 'Contact' form using name/email/message inputs for when you want spam from bots.
Has potential PHP functionality if it's on a server that supports it. Python local servers return a 501 error.

###LocalStorage!
localStorage functionality for saving form values courtesy of Jon Duckett's Javascript book.
Added an event listener for the submit button that clears the local storage form values.
