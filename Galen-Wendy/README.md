We also add external buttons for

  * Play
  * Pause
  * Fast Forward
  * Rewind
  * Restart
  * Switch to a video of a bear
  * A Fun button for panda sneezing.

## Camera Access via Browser Example!
We combined David Walsh's Camera Access / snapshot code with a Canvas Element drawing app to make a (slow) app that can draw over the captured image with black circles using mouseclicks.

##Email Form Example
A sample 'Contact' form using name/email/message inputs for when you want spam from bots.
Has potential PHP functionality if it's on a server that supports it. Python local servers return a 501 error.

####LocalStorage!
localStorage functionality for saving form values courtesy of Jon Duckett's Javascript book.
Added an event listener for the submit button that clears the local storage form values.

##Jade Examples!
###File Conversions!
Conversions of html5 semantic rebuild files to show what they look like in Jade! So efficient seeming! Wendy installed the Sublime Packages for Jade editing and played around a little.
