#HTML as a Platform
###A Project for Code Fellows B25 by Loann Lam and Sheyna Watkins

We decided to tie the examples into a social media music site. Loann took charge of the audio and video files and she wrote the responsive grid. Sheyna wrote the code for the form and camera. We both wrote HTML CSS and JavaScript for parts of the site.
