HTML5 As A Platform
===================

## Audio Plug - In
Craig used html5's audio tag to simply include audio into a page. A very simple tool, but much better than the options that were out there prviously.

## Camera Access
Ben used the camera access feature to give the user the opportunity to take massive amount of selfies on their computer. Through the use of a little bit of javascript and running the local python server this set up was successful with very minimal code and is a pretty fun tool.

## Forms
Craig created a form that allows the user to enter their personal and credit card info that not will notify the user when the form is incorrectly filled out. Although forms can be used in a myriad of ways we saw taking someones money as the most likely use case of the tool (other than an initial customer log in).

## Video 
We've all had a hard time with iframe videos and poor plug-in applications that look messy and dont allow the user to control the content they are viewing. With the use of the video tag it is a great way to add video to the background of a page, or set restrictions on audio, play/pause options and even start the video where we would like to if there is something in the beginning of a video that we dont see fit to burden the user with.
