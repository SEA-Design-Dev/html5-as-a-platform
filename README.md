#HTML5 as a platform
##By Emmanuel Santos and Ben Spears.

We have created a mock up for a home page on a site that would be a subscription based music **video** service. This page shows the use of the html5 video element with an autoplay feature which is also muted with no controls, so it can be used as a background for the site. The account creation link leads to a form to fill out, which uses validation to make sure each field is completed, as well as the correct semantic meaning for each type of input field.
